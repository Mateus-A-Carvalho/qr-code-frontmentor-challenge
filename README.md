## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was an easy challenge. I did it in about one hour(Desktop version). I needed to something to know the measures between the elements. I used a Chrome Extension called "Page Ruler" and also use GIMP in design images. 

This is the first challenge that I propoused to myself to earn new skills and get better in **Front-End Development**.
